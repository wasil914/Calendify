// This code defines a React component called `NewEventPage`, which renders a page for creating a new event. It uses a card layout to display a centered form on the screen. The card includes a header with the title "New Event" and a content section that contains the `EventForm` component, which likely handles the user input and submission logic for creating a new calendar event. The layout is styled using utility classes to make it visually appealing and responsive, ensuring a clean and focused user interface for event creation.

import EventForm from "@/components/forms/EventForm";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";

export default function NewEventPage(){
    return (
        // Container Card component centered on the page with a max width
        <Card className="max-w-md mx-auto border-8 border-blue-200 shadow-2xl shadow-accent-foreground">
          {/* Header section of the card displaying the title */}
          <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle>New Event</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
    
          {/* Content section of the card containing the event form */}
          <CardContent>
            <EventForm />
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      )
