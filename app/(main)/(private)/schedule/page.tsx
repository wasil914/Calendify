// This code defines a `SchedulePage` component that is responsible for rendering a user's schedule page. It first checks if the user is authenticated using Clerk's authentication system; if not, the user is redirected to the sign-in page. Then, it queries the database for the user's schedule, including any availability information associated with it. Once the schedule data is retrieved, it renders the page within a card layout, displaying a title and a `ScheduleForm` component populated with the user's schedule. This allows the user to view and possibly manage their schedule on the page.

import { ScheduleForm } from "@/components/forms/ScheduleForm"
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
import { getSchedule } from "@/server/actions/schedule"
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache"


// Default export function for the SchedulePage component
export default async function SchedulePage() {
    // Check if the user is authenticated (using Clerk authentication)
    const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()
    if (!userId) return redirectToSignIn() // Redirect to sign-in page if user is not authenticated

  // Query the database to fetch the user's schedule based on the authenticated user
  const schedule = await getSchedule(userId)
